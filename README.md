Here’s a suggested **README.md** file for your Amazon Storefront Database Interface project:

# Amazon Storefront Database Interface

This project is a simulation of an online storefront system that allows users to browse products, place orders, and manage store operations. The backend is built using **Java** and **PostgreSQL**, with **JDBC** used for database connectivity.

## Features
- **User Registration & Login**: Manage user accounts and authenticate users.
- **Product Browsing**: Search and filter through a list of 200 products.
- **Order Management**: Place and view orders from a set of 500 historical orders.
- **Database Automation**: Automate database creation, indexing, and data population with shell and SQL scripts.

## Project Structure
```bash

│   └── load_data.sql        # SQL script to load data into the tables
```

## Prerequisites
- **Java JDK**: Ensure Java is installed on your machine.
- **PostgreSQL**: A running instance of PostgreSQL with appropriate permissions.
- **JDBC Driver**: Ensure the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is available (e.g., `pg73jdbc3.jar`).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd amazon-storefront
    ```

2. **Database Setup**:
    - Make sure PostgreSQL is running, and create a new database.
    - Run the database setup scripts:
      ```bash
      ./db/create_db.sh
      ```

3. **Compile the Java Program**:
    ```bash
    ./src/compile.sh
    ```

4. **Run the Program**:
    ```bash
    java -cp ./classes:./lib/pg73jdbc3.jar Amazon <database_name> <port> <username>
    ```

## Usage
Once the system is running, users can perform the following actions:
- **Register as a new user**.
- **Browse products** and filter based on criteria.
- **Place an order** and view order history.

## Data Breakdown
- **200 products** available for browsing and ordering.
- **100 users** in the system with authentication capabilities.
- **500 orders** stored in the database for order management and viewing.
